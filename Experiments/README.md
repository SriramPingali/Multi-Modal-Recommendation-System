 - Run "Audio Features.ipynb" to generate Embeddings of the Audio files (Present in "Datasets/ml-100k/Audio") into "Datasets/ml-100k/Audio/embeddings.csv"
 - Run "Text Features.ipynb" to generate Embeddings of Textual Summaries of movies in "Datasets/ml-100k/Text/items.csv".
 - Run "Movie_lens.ipynb" to run the collaborative filtering algorithm and to generate predictions.

```NOTE: The 1st and 2nd steps could be skipped and you can directly perform prediction if the setup is properly done.```
